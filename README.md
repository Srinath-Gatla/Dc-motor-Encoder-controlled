# Dc-motor-Encoder-controlled
This code:  Controls a DC motor using PWM and direction pins.  Reads pulses from a rotary encoder to track position and direction.  Calculates and prints motor speed (RPM) and encoder position (pulses) over time.  Uses an interrupt to detect encoder changes for better accuracy and responsiveness.
